# Geronimo
A lightweight machine-learning library for C++, inspired by the Keras API.

I made this primarily for educational purposes, but also for the lack of an open-source, intuitive C++ API. Python is a joke.

If you'd be interested in contributing to this project, or have any feature recommendations please let me know!

## Prerequesites
This project was made using the [Armadillo C++ Matrix Library](https://gitlab.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code).

While not a requirement to build this project, I recommend using the [Matplot++ Library](https://alandefreitas.github.io/matplotplusplus/) for data visualization!

## Building
Run `make` in the root project directory.
